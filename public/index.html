        <p>
            Definitely want to feel comforted with the story in it, right?<br>
             Therefore, lazy too if too many serious and thrilling scenes are lifted.<br>
              Relax One Piece always has its own way to tell a serious scene.<br>
               Oda is always able to slip the side of humor in serious scenes<br>
                that will at least make you smile.
